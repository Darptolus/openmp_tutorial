    "# Lab2: Parallelism Generation in Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this lab is to better understand parallelism generation in OpenMP. Parallelism generation is the ability to create workers. Some of these concepts were briefly introduced in [lab1](../Lab1/lab1.ipynb). In this lab we will describe them more in depth\n",

    "## Parallel regions\n",
    "Since its origin, OpenMP has focus on parallel regions. Parallel regions are created with the `#pragma omp parallel` directive, and its purpose is to generate a collection of software threads, each entering the same region of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `parallel` construct generates a `team of threads` containing one or more threads. There are different factors that influence how many threads are created and the user have some control over these. One factor that we cannot control as users is the system limitation. OpenMP is portable across systems, however, each system may impose limitations on how many threads can be generated. For example, an embedded system with a light weight operating system may not allow thread oversubscription (see lab 1 for details on this), a batch scheduler may restrict the number of threads in an application, or an OpenMP compiler implementation may decide to limit the number of threads it can handle to a maximum number.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two rules of thumb:\n",
    "1. Number of threads used by the application is not guaranteed to be equal to the number of threads requested. The actual number of threads may be less or implementation defined. It is not a good idea for applications to rely on the number of threads as this will limit portability (Use discretion here, as there are good reasons to break this rule.)\n",
    "2. System oversubscription is not recommended, when all the threads will be constantly busy, as this has demonstrated to reduce application performance. Still, some applications use thread oversubscription to have some threads that do little work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Elements that affect the number of threads:\n",
    "* The `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable\n",
    "* The `omp_set_num_threads()` API call\n",
    "* The `num_threads()` clause of the `parallel` construct\n",
    "* The `if()` clause of the `parallel` construct\n",
    "* The `OMP_DYNAMIC` environment variable\n",
    "* The `omp_set_dynamic()` API call\n",
    "* The `thread_limit()` clause in the `teams` directive\n",
    "* The `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT` and `OMP_TEAMS_THREAD_LIMIT` environment variable\n",
    "* The `OMP_NESTED` and `OMP_MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS` environment variables\n",

    "In this section we will try to cover most of these. For the following example, we assume that we are running on a system that supports more threads.\n",
